# Load a session

## Context

- Sessions: @.sessions/

## Preflight

- If `$ARGUMENT` is provided:
Set `$SESSION_NAME` to `$ARGUMENT`, ensuring it is a valid session filename with `.md` extension.

- If `$ARGUMENT` is not provided
Set `$SESSION_NAME` to the current session name from `.sessions/.current-session`, if it exists.
If it does not exist, STOP and prompt the user to specify a session name.

## Task

1. Take the `$SESSION_NAME` and check if a file exists at `.sessions/$SESSION_NAME`.
2. If the session file does **not** exist:
   - Notify the user that the session was not found.
   - List all available `.md` session files located in the `.sessions/` directory.
   - Prompt the user to choose from the list.
3. If the session file **does** exist:
   - Update the current session pointer by writing the `$SESSION_NAME` filename to `.sessions/.current-session`.
4. Load the session file content.
5. Check for running Background Bash Shells.

## Output

```markdown
Loaded the session `$SESSION_NAME` successfully. Here is a summary of the session:
